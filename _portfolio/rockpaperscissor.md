title: "Rock Paper Scissors"
description: "To teach Git at workshops, I created a game of Rock Paper Scissors. Workshop participants can clone the repository to play the game. They partner up and make their choice of Rock, Paper or Scissors in a text file. There they can work through Git commands; clone, add, commit, push, pull, and merge"
